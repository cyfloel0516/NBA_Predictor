# NBA_Predictor
This project is for my Data Mining course term project. In this project, I perform prediction based on player performance instead of team match history. This method has some benefits:
1. Assign more weight to key player by compare their average minutes played.
2. Compare each pair of players instead just compare the team match history.
3. Can be easily to special cases for example injuries, trades or DNP
